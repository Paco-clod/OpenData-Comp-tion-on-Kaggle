# OpenData-Comp-tion-on-Kaggle
In celebration of Open Data Day and during the holy month of Ramadan, we invite you to participate in a unique image classification challenge focused on one of the most cherished fruits in the MENA region: dates. Dates are not only a staple in our diet but also hold cultural and religious significance.

This competition aims to advance the field of computer vision by developing algorithms that can accurately classify different types of dates, such as "Madjool," "Sukkary," and "Ajwah."

Note:
External data: Using external data for training is strictly prohibited.
Code review: All submitted code will be reviewed for compliance.
Eligibility for prizes: While the competition is open to everyone, prizes will only be awarded to participants residing in Saudi Arabia

Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images. It is a straightforward and widely used metric for classification tasks.

The accuracy is calculated using the following formula:


Participants' models will be ranked based on their accuracy on the test dataset. The higher the accuracy, the better the model's performance. In the event of a tie, the submission time will be considered, with earlier submissions taking precedence.

Submission File
For each unique filename in the test set, you must predict the correct class id for the TARGET variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
