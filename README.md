# OpenData-Comp-tion-on-Kaggle
In celebration of Open Data Day and during the holy month of Ramadan, we invite you to participate in a unique image classification challenge focused on one of the most cherished fruits in the MENA region: dates. Dates are not only a staple in our diet but also hold cultural and religious significance.
